The ChairVisE app is intended for program Chairs of academic and industry conferences to visualize statistical trends in research paper submissions at their conferences. 

It generates informative, aesthetically pleasing and interactive visualization charts given CSV data on research topics, authors, reviews etc of papers submitted over multiple years. 

The insights produced by these visualizations will empower conference organizers to make more informed decisions about conference programming and outreach; researchers and industry stakeholders will also be able to learn more about th eresearch landscape of different domains.
